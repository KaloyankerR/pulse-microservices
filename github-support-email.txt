Subject: Stuck GitHub Actions Workflow Runs - Unable to Cancel (Repository: KaloyankerR/pulse-microservices)

Dear GitHub Support Team,

I am experiencing an issue with stuck workflow runs in my repository that I am unable to cancel through normal methods.

**Repository Details:**
- Repository: KaloyankerR/pulse-microservices
- Repository URL: https://github.com/KaloyankerR/pulse-microservices

**Issue Description:**
I have two workflow runs that are stuck in a "queued" state and have been unable to start executing for an extended period. These runs are blocking new workflow executions.

**Affected Workflow Runs:**
1. Run ID: 18380007095
   - Status: queued
   - Workflow: Microservices Pipeline
   - URL: https://github.com/KaloyankerR/pulse-microservices/actions/runs/18380007095

2. Run ID: 18379924371
   - Status: queued
   - Workflow: Microservices Pipeline
   - URL: https://github.com/KaloyankerR/pulse-microservices/actions/runs/18379924371

**Steps Already Attempted:**
1. Attempted to cancel via GitHub CLI:
   - Command: `gh run cancel 18380007095`
   - Result: HTTP 500 error - "Failed to cancel workflow run"
   
2. Attempted to cancel via GitHub CLI for second run:
   - Command: `gh run cancel 18379924371`
   - Result: HTTP 500 error - "Failed to cancel workflow run"

3. The workflow runs appear to be stuck in an infinite queued state, not progressing to execution and not allowing cancellation through the API.

**Impact:**
- Unable to execute new pipeline updates
- Workflow queue is blocked
- Development and deployment processes are impacted

**Request:**
Could you please manually cancel these two stuck workflow runs (IDs: 18380007095 and 18379924371) from your end? Additionally, if there are any underlying issues with the Actions runners or quota that might be causing this, I would appreciate any insights or recommendations.

**Additional Context:**
I have already implemented concurrency controls in my workflow file to prevent similar issues in the future:
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

I appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue so I can continue with my development workflow.

Thank you for your time and support.
