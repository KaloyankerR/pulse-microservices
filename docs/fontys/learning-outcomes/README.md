# Learning Outcomes Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation demonstrating achievement of all seven learning outcomes for the Pulse microservices project.

## Overview

The Pulse platform is a Twitter-like social media application with event management capabilities, built using microservices architecture. This documentation demonstrates how the project addresses each learning outcome through practical implementation and reflection.

## Learning Outcomes Documentation

### [LO1: Professional Standard](./LO1-Professional-Standard/README.md)
**Evidence**: Applied research using DOT framework, stakeholder communication, professional software delivery, critical thinking, and future-oriented design.

### [LO2: Personal Leadership](./LO2-Personal-Leadership/README.md)
**Evidence**: Goal setting, feedback seeking, self-directed action, reflective practice, and long-term professional development.

### [LO3: Scalable Architectures](./LO3-Scalable-Architectures/README.md)
**Evidence**: Non-functional requirements, microservices architecture, scalability patterns, quality implementation, and architectural patterns.

### [LO4: Development and Operations (DevOps)](./LO4-Development-and-Operations/README.md)
**Evidence**: Containerization, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, monitoring, infrastructure as code, and deployment strategies.

### [LO5: Cloud Native](./LO5-Cloud-Native/README.md)
**Evidence**: Cloud-native architecture, containerization, cloud services integration, scalability, and multi-cloud readiness.

### [LO6: Security by Design](./LO6-Security-by-Design/README.md)
**Evidence**: OWASP Top 10 addressing, authentication/authorization, input validation, data protection, and security monitoring.

### [LO7: Distributed Data](./LO7-Distributed-Data/README.md)
**Evidence**: Polyglot persistence, data consistency patterns, GDPR compliance, performance optimization, and ethical considerations.

## Project Context

**Platform**: Pulse - Twitter Clone with Events Features  
**Architecture**: Microservices (6 services: user, post, social, messaging, notification, event)  
**Technologies**: Node.js, Go, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ  
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Kong API Gateway  
**Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana  

## Documentation Structure

Each learning outcome document follows a consistent structure:
1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of the learning outcome
2. **Evidence Sections**: Detailed evidence of achievement
3. **Implementation Examples**: Code snippets and configurations
4. **Validation**: Metrics, test results, and performance data
5. **Conclusion**: Summary and reflection
