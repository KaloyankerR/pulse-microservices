# Week 9
---

# Task
- Create a new weekly report in `fontys/progress report/`.
- Make it short, concise and condensed.

---

# Input
Take the progress I have made during this week (week 9) and describe it in the report. 

- Divided `user-service` into `user-service` and `auth-service`
- Frontend adjusting to the new service update
- Load-testing implementation
- Kubernetes initial implementation
- Moderator roles feature
- Moderator page

---

# Constraints
- Follow the naming convention of the other files in that folder.
- The file should not be longer than 300 rows. 
- Do not halucinate look at the codebase and describe what was implemented there.
- Mirror the learning outcome section structure from previous progress reports and assign a self-grade for each outcome using the scale `Undefined`, `Orienting`, `Beginning`, `Proficient`, `Outstanding`.
- When a weekly feature deserves deeper focus, create supplemental learning-outcome documents that follow the established structure in `docs/fontys/learning-outcomes/`.

---

# Output
- Create a new markdown file in `fontys/progress report/`. 

---

# Verify
