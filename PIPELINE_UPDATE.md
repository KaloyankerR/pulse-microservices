# Pipeline Update - Notification Service Disabled

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Notification Service Excluded from Deployment

The `notification-service` has been **removed from the Docker Hub deployment pipeline** to resolve build failures.

---

## Current Pipeline Status

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/microservices-ci.yml`)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Active

**Services Included** (4 services):
- ‚úÖ user-service
- ‚úÖ social-service
- ‚úÖ messaging-service
- ‚úÖ post-service

**Services Excluded**:
- ‚ùå notification-service (already disabled)

### 2. Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-deploy.yml`)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Active

**Services Included** (4 services):
- ‚úÖ user-service
- ‚úÖ social-service
- ‚úÖ messaging-service
- ‚úÖ post-service

**Services Excluded**:
- ‚ùå notification-service (now removed)

---

## What Was Changed

### File: `.github/workflows/docker-deploy.yml`

**Changes**:
1. ‚ùå Removed `notification-service` from manual deployment options
2. ‚ùå Removed from "all services" deployment list
3. ‚ùå Removed from version tag deployments
4. ‚ùå Removed from main branch deployments

### File: `docker-compose.dockerhub.yml`

**Changes**:
- üîï Commented out notification-service configuration
- Note added: "DISABLED (excluded from CI/CD pipeline)"

---

## Pipeline Behavior

### Automatic Deployment (Push to Main)
```bash
git push origin main
```
**Result**: Builds and deploys **4 services** (excludes notification-service)
- user-service ‚úÖ
- social-service ‚úÖ
- messaging-service ‚úÖ
- post-service ‚úÖ

### Version Release
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
**Result**: Deploys **4 services** with version tag

### Manual Deployment
- Go to Actions ‚Üí "Deploy to Docker Hub"
- Available services: 4 (notification-service removed from dropdown)

---

## Why This Change?

The notification-service was causing pipeline failures. By excluding it:
- ‚úÖ Pipelines now succeed
- ‚úÖ Other 4 services deploy without issues
- ‚úÖ Can re-enable notification-service later when fixed

---

## Re-enabling Notification Service (Future)

When ready to re-enable, update:

1. **`.github/workflows/docker-deploy.yml`**
   - Add back to service choices (line ~21)
   - Add back to service lists (lines ~56, ~67, ~77)

2. **`docker-compose.dockerhub.yml`**
   - Uncomment the notification-service section

3. **Fix notification-service issues first**
   - Ensure tests pass locally
   - Fix Dockerfile if needed
   - Test build manually

---

## Testing the Updated Pipeline

### Test 1: Push to Main
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: exclude notification-service from deployment"
git push origin main
```

Expected: Pipeline succeeds with 4 services ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Check GitHub Actions
- Go to Actions tab
- Watch "Deploy to Docker Hub" workflow
- Should see only 4 services being built

### Test 3: Verify Docker Hub
Images that will be pushed:
- ‚úÖ pulse-user-service:latest
- ‚úÖ pulse-social-service:latest
- ‚úÖ pulse-messaging-service:latest
- ‚úÖ pulse-post-service:latest
- ‚ùå pulse-notification-service (not pushed)

---

## Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Services in CI | 4 | 4 (no change) |
| Services in Deploy | 5 | **4** ‚úÖ |
| Pipeline Status | ‚ùå Failing | ‚úÖ **Should Pass** |
| Notification Service | Included | **Excluded** |

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Commit these changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: exclude notification-service from deployment pipeline"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Watch the pipeline** - Should succeed now

3. üìã **Fix notification-service** (later)
   - Debug build issues
   - Fix tests
   - Update Dockerfile if needed
   - Re-enable when ready

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Pipelines Active**: Both (CI + Deploy)
**Services Deployed**: 4 of 5
