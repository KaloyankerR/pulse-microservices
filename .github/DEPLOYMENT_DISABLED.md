# Deployment Workflow Status

## üö´ Deployment is Currently DISABLED

The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) has been disabled and will not run automatically.

### What's Disabled

- ‚ùå Automatic deployment on version tags
- ‚ùå Manual deployment via workflow dispatch
- ‚ùå Service-specific tag deployments

### What Still Works

- ‚úÖ CI/CD testing (all services)
- ‚úÖ PR validation
- ‚úÖ Code quality checks
- ‚úÖ Docker image builds (validation only, no push)

## üìã Current Status

| Workflow | Status | Runs On |
|----------|--------|---------|
| CI | ‚úÖ Active | Push, PR |
| PR Validation | ‚úÖ Active | PR events |
| Code Quality | ‚úÖ Active | Push, PR, Weekly |
| **Deploy** | ‚ùå **DISABLED** | *None* |

## üîß How to Re-enable Deployment

When you're ready to enable deployments:

### Step 1: Edit the Workflow File

Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and find this section at the top:

```yaml
# Deployment workflow is currently disabled
# To re-enable, uncomment the 'on:' section below

# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - 'v*.*.*'
#       - 'user-service-v*.*.*'
#       - 'social-service-v*.*.*'
#       - 'messaging-service-v*.*.*'
#       - 'post-service-v*.*.*'
#   workflow_dispatch:
#     inputs:
#       service:
#         description: 'Service to deploy'
#         required: true
#         type: choice
#         options:
#           - all
#           - user-service
#           - social-service
#           - messaging-service
#           - post-service
#       environment:
#         description: 'Deployment environment'
#         required: true
#         type: choice
#         options:
#           - staging
#           - production
```

### Step 2: Uncomment the Triggers

Remove the `#` from all the lines to uncomment them.

### Step 3: Remove Temporary Trigger

Delete or comment out this temporary section:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      confirm_enable:
        description: 'Type "ENABLE" to manually trigger this disabled workflow'
        required: true
        type: string
```

### Step 4: Update Job Conditions

Remove the condition from the first job:

```yaml
jobs:
  determine-services:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.inputs.confirm_enable == 'ENABLE'  # ‚Üê Remove this line
```

And remove the warning step:

```yaml
- name: Warning - Deployment is disabled  # ‚Üê Remove this entire step
  run: |
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This deployment workflow is currently disabled!"
    echo "This workflow should only run for testing purposes."
    echo "To fully enable, update the 'on:' triggers in deploy.yml"
```

### Step 5: Configure Secrets

Make sure you have these secrets configured:

```
Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions:
- DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
- DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
```

### Step 6: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "ci: enable deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Test

Create a test tag to verify it works:

```bash
git tag -a test-v0.0.1 -m "Test deployment"
git push origin test-v0.0.1
```

## üéØ Quick Enable Script

If you want to quickly enable deployment, you can run:

```bash
# This will create a new branch with deployment enabled
git checkout -b enable-deployment

# Make the edits (you'll need to do this manually)
# Then:
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "ci: enable deployment workflow"
git push origin enable-deployment

# Create PR and merge
```

## üìù Why Was It Disabled?

Deployment workflows are disabled by default to prevent:

1. ‚ùå Accidental deployments before infrastructure is ready
2. ‚ùå Pushing to registries without proper authentication
3. ‚ùå Deploying to production without proper testing
4. ‚ùå Wasting GitHub Actions minutes on failed deployments

## ‚úÖ Checklist Before Enabling

Before re-enabling deployment, ensure:

- [ ] Docker Hub account is created (or GHCR is configured)
- [ ] `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` secret is set
- [ ] `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secret is set
- [ ] You understand the tagging strategy
- [ ] You have a rollback plan
- [ ] You've tested Docker builds locally
- [ ] Infrastructure is ready to receive deployments
- [ ] You've reviewed the deployment workflow
